# Phase 06: Identifying User Experience Rough Edges

This phase systematically explores the application from a user's perspective to identify and document rough edges, usability issues, and opportunities for improvement. This creates a backlog of valuable contributions you can make to improve the product.

## Tasks

- [ ] Create a user-experience-issues.md file in Auto Run Docs to track findings
- [ ] Perform a fresh user onboarding flow (create account or organization if applicable) and note any friction points
- [ ] Test the workspace creation flow end-to-end, documenting unclear labels, missing validation, or confusing steps
- [ ] Attempt to perform common Terraform operations and note any error messages that could be clearer
- [ ] Navigate through all main sections of the UI (workspaces, settings, templates, etc.) looking for inconsistent styling
- [ ] Test form validation across different forms, identifying missing validation or unhelpful error messages
- [ ] Look for loading states - identify any actions that don't show loading indicators when they should
- [ ] Test error scenarios by attempting invalid operations and assessing whether error messages are helpful
- [ ] Check responsive behavior by resizing the browser window and noting any layout issues
- [ ] Review accessibility basics: can you navigate with keyboard only? Are there proper labels for screen readers?
- [ ] Identify any buttons or actions that lack clear confirmation or success feedback
- [ ] Look for inconsistent terminology or labels across different parts of the application
- [ ] Note any features that seem partially implemented or have TODO comments in the code
- [ ] Categorize issues by severity (critical bugs, usability issues, polish opportunities) in your documentation
- [ ] Prioritize the top 5 issues that would have the most impact on user experience if fixed
- [ ] For each top issue, document the current behavior, expected behavior, and potential solution approach
